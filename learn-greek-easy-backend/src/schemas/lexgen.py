"""LEXGEN morphological form schemas — feature-keyed, POS-neutral (LEXGEN-02-01).

This module holds the Layer-0 representation for inflected forms in the LEXGEN
word-proposal pipeline. A form is carried as a ``FormBundle``: the surface
string plus a ``features`` dict keyed by a controlled vocabulary
(``FEATURE_KEYS``). This is the canonical internal shape; flat keys like
``genitive_plural`` exist only at the UI edge and are converted in/out by the
strict converters (LEXGEN-02-03, ``src/core/lexgen_forms.py``).

Invariants
----------
- **Seam #1 — feature-keyed forms.** Internally a form's morphology is a dict
  of ``{feature_key: value}`` (e.g. ``{"case": "genitive", "number": "plural"}``).
  Flat, underscore-joined keys (``genitive_plural``) are a UI-edge convenience
  only; they never appear inside a ``FormBundle.features`` dict. The boundary is
  enforced by the feature-key validator below (any key ∉ ``FEATURE_KEYS`` —
  including a flat key — is rejected).
- **Seam #5 — POS-neutral.** A ``FormBundle`` makes no assumption about part of
  speech. ``gender`` is just one feature key among ten, no more privileged than
  ``case`` or ``tense``; nouns simply happen to use ``case``/``number``/``gender``
  while verbs use ``person``/``tense``/``mood``/etc. No source/lexicon access
  happens in this story — these are pure value types.

Value-mapping table (LEXGEN-08 join contract)
----------------------------------------------
The verified noun mapping from UD-canonical feature values (as produced upstream,
lowercase English) to the ``GreekLexicon`` column value (English UD abbreviation):

    feature key   UD canonical value        GreekLexicon column → value
    -----------   -----------------------   ---------------------------
    case          nominative                ptosi   → "Nom"
    case          genitive                  ptosi   → "Gen"
    case          accusative                ptosi   → "Acc"
    case          vocative                  ptosi   → "Voc"
    number        singular                  number  → "Sing"
    number        plural                    number  → "Plur"
    gender        masculine                 gender  → "Masc"
    gender        feminine                  gender  → "Fem"
    gender        neuter                    gender  → "Neut"
    (pos)         noun                       pos     → "NOUN"

Evidence (production code, verified — the dev lexicon table is empty and prod is
network-blocked, so the mapping is sourced from the live mapping dicts):
  - ``src/services/local_verification_service.py:28`` ``_CASE_MAP`` →
    nominative/genitive/accusative/vocative ↦ Nom/Gen/Acc/Voc.
  - ``src/services/local_verification_service.py:29`` ``_NUMBER_MAP`` →
    singular/plural ↦ Sing/Plur.
  - ``src/utils/greek_articles.py:27`` ``GENDER_MAP`` →
    Masc/Fem/Neut ↦ masculine/feminine/neuter (this module's table is the inverse
    direction: UD canonical → column value).
  - ``src/db/models.py`` ``GreekLexicon`` column comments confirm the stored
    abbreviations: ``ptosi`` "Grammatical case (Nom, Gen, Acc, Voc)",
    ``number`` "(Sing, Plur)", ``gender`` "(Masc, Fem, Neut)".
  - ``pos`` "NOUN" is the Universal POS tag, consistent with
    ``src/schemas/nlp.py`` ``MorphologyResult.pos``.

``person`` type-impedance caveat (verb path — DOCUMENTATION ONLY)
----------------------------------------------------------------
``GreekLexicon.person`` is a ``SmallInteger`` storing the integer person 1/2/3
(``src/db/models.py`` — ``comment="Grammatical person (1, 2, 3) for verb forms"``),
NOT a string. A feature-exact join on ``person`` would therefore require an
explicit cast, e.g. ``CAST(GreekLexicon.person AS TEXT) == features["person"]``;
the value is not directly string-join-ready against a ``features`` dict (whose
values are always strings). No ``person`` value map, join, or cast ships in this
story — this caveat is recorded here so the LEXGEN-08 join implementation does
not silently mismatch on it. Verb feature *values* (tense/aspect/mood/voice/etc.)
are likewise documented out of scope here; only the noun value map is authored.
