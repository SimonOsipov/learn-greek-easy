  # JOB 3: Deploy Frontend
  # Purpose: Deploy frontend service after backend, with fresh DNS to discover new backend IP
  #
  # WHY THIS ORDER MATTERS:
  # - Backend is private (no public URL), only accessible via frontend Caddy proxy
  # - Frontend uses Caddy to proxy /api/* to backend.railway.internal:8080
  # - When backend redeploys, it gets a NEW internal IP address
  # - Railway's internal DNS needs ~10-15 seconds to propagate the new IP
  # - If we warm-up BEFORE frontend redeploys, the old frontend has STALE DNS
  #   pointing to the old backend IP, causing 502 errors
  # - By deploying frontend AFTER backend + DNS delay, the new frontend container
  #   starts fresh and discovers the correct new backend IP
