**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Bug ID**: BUG-09.07
**Severity**: 🟡 Medium (Feature removal)
**Created**: 2025-11-07
**Started**: 2025-11-07
**Completed**: 2025-11-07
**Estimated Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**Actual Duration**: 8 minutes

## Overview

Settings page displays "Account ID" section showing user ID (e.g., "user-1") with description "Your unique account identifier for support purposes." This feature is not needed in MVP and should be removed entirely.

---

## Objectives

- Remove the entire "Account ID" display section
- Remove any associated dividers
- Clean up layout after removal
- Ensure no functionality depends on Account ID display

---

## Current Behavior

**Expected Location** (may not exist in current codebase):
- Settings page or AccountSection component
- Section showing: "Account ID"
- Value displayed: User's unique identifier (e.g., "user-1", UUID, or similar)
- Description: "Your unique account identifier for support purposes"
- Possibly includes a divider above or below

**Note**: This section may not currently exist in the codebase. If not found, mark task as "Already Removed" and verify Settings page is clean.

---

## Expected Behavior

After removal:
- No Account ID section in Settings
- No user ID displayed in UI
- Account ID accessible only through backend/database for support team
- Clean Settings layout without developer/internal identifiers

---

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Search for Account ID Section (3 min)

**Search in these files**:
1. `/Users/samosipov/Downloads/learn-greek-easy/learn-greek-easy-frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx`
2. `/Users/samosipov/Downloads/learn-greek-easy/learn-greek-easy-frontend/src/components/settings/AccountSection.tsx`
3. `/Users/samosipov/Downloads/learn-greek-easy/learn-greek-easy-frontend/src/components/settings/AppPreferencesSection.tsx`

**Search strings**:
- "Account ID"
- "account identifier"
- "user-1"
- `user.id`
- "support purposes"

**Action**: If found, proceed to Step 2. If not found, verify and mark task complete (already removed).

### Step 2: Remove Account ID Section JSX (5 min)

**If found, delete the entire section**:

**Example pattern to remove**:
```tsx
{/* DELETE THIS BLOCK */}
{/* Account ID */}
<div className="space-y-3">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <Info className="h-4 w-4 text-muted-foreground" />
    <h3 className="font-medium">Account ID</h3>
  </div>

  <div className="p-4 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg">
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
      Your unique account identifier for support purposes
    </p>
    <p className="mt-2 font-mono text-sm">
      {user.id}
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

{/* Remove divider if present */}
<Divider />
```

### Step 3: Remove Associated Imports (2 min)

**Check if any icons were only used for Account ID section**:
```tsx
import { Info, User, IdCard } from 'lucide-react'; // Remove unused icons
```

**Action**: Remove unused icon imports after deletion

### Step 4: Verify Layout (3 min)

**Test Checklist**:
- [ ] Navigate to `/settings`
- [ ] Verify no "Account ID" section
- [ ] Verify spacing between remaining sections is consistent
- [ ] No empty gaps or orphaned dividers
- [ ] All other sections display correctly

---

## Testing Checklist

### Verification
- [ ] "Account ID" section not visible
- [ ] No user ID displayed in Settings UI
- [ ] No orphaned dividers
- [ ] Layout spacing consistent

### Remaining Functionality
- [ ] All other Settings sections work correctly
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No console errors

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] Account ID section removed from Settings
- [x] No user ID displayed to end users
- [x] Clean Settings layout
- [x] No unused imports
- [x] No TypeScript errors

---

## Files to Modify

**Primary File**: TBD (after search)
- Most likely: `/Users/samosipov/Downloads/learn-greek-easy/learn-greek-easy-frontend/src/components/settings/AccountSection.tsx`

**Estimated Lines Removed**: 15-25 lines

---

## Notes

- This section may not exist in current codebase
- If not found, verify Settings page and mark task complete
- Account IDs should remain in database but hidden from UI
- Support team can access IDs through admin panel or database
- Should take less than 15 minutes including search
