## Expected Behavior

After removal:
- No "Simulate Study Session" button
- No demo/testing sections in Settings
- Production-ready Settings page
- Testing features accessible only in development environment (if needed)

---

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Search for Simulate Study Session (3 min)

**Search locations**:
1. `/Users/samosipov/Downloads/learn-greek-easy/learn-greek-easy-frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx`
2. `/Users/samosipov/Downloads/learn-greek-easy/learn-greek-easy-frontend/src/components/settings/AppPreferencesSection.tsx`
3. `/Users/samosipov/Downloads/learn-greek-easy/learn-greek-easy-frontend/src/components/settings/AccountSection.tsx`
4. Any settings component files

**Search strings**:
- "Simulate Study Session"
- "Simulate"
- "Demo:"
- "Test progress"
- "Testing"
- "Developer"

**Action**: If found, proceed to removal. If not found, verify and complete task.

### Step 2: Remove Simulation Section (5 min)

**Example pattern to remove**:
```tsx
{/* DELETE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK */}
{/* Demo: Test Progress Tracking */}
<div className="space-y-3">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <Beaker className="h-4 w-4 text-muted-foreground" />
    <h3 className="font-medium">Demo: Test progress tracking</h3>
  </div>

  <div className="p-4 bg-muted/50 rounded-lg">
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-3">
      Simulate completing a study session to test analytics
    </p>
    <Button
      variant="outline"
      size="sm"
      onClick={handleSimulateSession}
    >
      Simulate Study Session
    </Button>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Step 3: Remove Handler Function (2 min)

**Delete simulation handler**:
```tsx
// DELETE THIS FUNCTION
const handleSimulateSession = () => {
  // Simulation logic
  analyticsStore.recordSession({/* ... */});
  toast({
    title: 'Session simulated',
    description: 'Progress has been updated for testing',
  });
};
```

### Step 4: Clean Up Imports (2 min)

**Remove unused imports**:
```tsx
import { Beaker, Flask, TestTube } from 'lucide-react'; // Remove demo-related icons
```

**Action**: Remove any icons/utilities only used for simulation feature

### Step 5: Verify Settings Page (3 min)

**Test Checklist**:
- [ ] Navigate to `/settings`
- [ ] Verify no "Simulate" button
- [ ] Verify no "Demo" or "Testing" sections
- [ ] All production sections present and functional
- [ ] No console errors
