## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Complete comprehensive documentation of all UI components and extract common patterns for improved code reusability.

**Scope:**
Track A - Documentation (5 subtasks):
- Authentication components documentation
- Layout components documentation
- Page components documentation
- Style guide patterns
- Quality assurance and cross-reference validation

Track B - Component Refactoring (6 subtasks):
- Form patterns extraction
- Dialog patterns
- Empty state component
- Loading components
- Error boundary components
- Testing and integration

**Why It Matters:**
- 21 components (37% of codebase) lacked documentation
- 5 critical design pattern categories were missing
- Complete documentation ensures code quality and consistency
- Serves as single source of truth for UI implementation

**Deliverables:**
- Components-Reference.md fully updated
- Style Guide with all pattern categories
- Extracted reusable form and dialog patterns
- EmptyState, LoadingSpinner, ErrorBoundary components
- Complete TypeScript interfaces for all components
